# Sauce the AUX

## Music Playlist Creator

An application that can be used by anyone who listens to music, **Sauce the AUX** 
is a playlist creator that groups and manages all your favourite songs based on their genre. 
Who picks the genre's? You!

As someone with 50+ playlists swimming around, it's increasingly difficult to manage
all of my favourite songs into a new playlist. 

With this app, you'll have the opportunity to add songs to the database with multiple different genre's attached
that you create. Then you can request to create a playlist based on a genre that you pick 
(e.g. Pop, Rap, Jazz)!. Sauce the AUX saves time, effort, and allows you to get creative with your playlist
combinations!
